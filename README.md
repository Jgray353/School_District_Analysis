# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to use Jupyter Notebook to read in .CSV files to create dataframes for displaying various metrics for math and reading broken down by district type, grade, and school. And this is to provide insight on performance trends and patterns. The reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th grade are changed to nAn as there was academic dishonesty from the 9th graders.  

## Results
